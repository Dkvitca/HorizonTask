### Review of PlotOccurrences and ProbCorrections Classes ###

#### PlotOccurrences Class ####
- **__init__**: O(n) due to calls to fetch_data and process_data.
- **fetch_data**: O(1), primarily dependent on network I/O.
- **process_data**: O(n), due to Savitzky-Golay filter application. documentation: "https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/SavitzkyGolay.html"
- **peak finding**:  O(n) linear with respect to the number of data points. documentation: "https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v1.13.0/scipy/signal/_peak_finding.py#L729-L1010"
- **plot_data**: O(n), iterates through data to generate plots.

#### Total Complexity for PlotOccurrences ####
Overall complexity: O(n)


#### ProbCorrections Class ####
- **__init__**: O(n) due to calls to fetch_data and process_data.
- **fetch_data**: O(1), primarily involves network I/O.
- **process_data**: O(n), similar operations as in PlotOccurrences.
- **calculate_days_since_previous_trend_end**: O(n), iterates through each date to calculate days.
- **calculate_average_intervals**: O(n), calculates intervals based on correction dates, linear with respect to the number of corrections.
- **calculate**: O(n), combines multiple linear operations.
- **plot_data**: O(n), involves plotting operations that iterate over calculated data.

#### Total Complexity for ProbCorrections ####
Overall complexity: O(n), as most operations are linear with respect to data size.





### Review of DataAnalyzer Class ###

#### __init__ ####
- **Complexity**: O(1), initializes instance variables.

#### fetch_data ####
- **Complexity**: Typically O(1), depends on network conditions and API response.

#### process_data ####
- **Complexity**: O(n) due to Savitzky-Golay filter application, peak and trough detection.

#### calculate_percentage_changes ####
- **Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of peaks/troughs. Typically O(n) in the worst case.

#### identify_downward_trends ####
- **Complexity**: O(m), directly proportional to the number of calculated percentage changes. O(n) in the worst case.

#### plot_data ####
- **Complexity**: Dependent on the implementation in subclasses but generally O(n) if it involves plotting all data points.

#### Overall Complexity for DataAnalyzer ####
Overall complexity: O(n), dominated by linear data processing functions across the class methods.
